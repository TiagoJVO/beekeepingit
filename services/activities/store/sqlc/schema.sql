-- sqlc's virtual schema for codegen only — NOT a bootstrap baseline, and never
-- applied to a database. It mirrors the cumulative "up" state of ../migrations/,
-- which since #541's squash is the single 00002_baseline.sql (plus any migration
-- added after it).
--
-- Keep in sync BY HAND when a migration changes a shape sqlc generates from. The
-- migrations are the real schema; this file only teaches sqlc the column types, so
-- drift surfaces as wrong generated Go types rather than as a failed migration —
-- which is exactly why it is worth stating here.
