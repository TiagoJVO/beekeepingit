/// (`powersync_connector.dart`'s `handleUploadResponse`) writes one row per op
/// in a rejected push before it `complete()`s the CRUD transaction — so the op
/// leaves PowerSync's upload queue (the queue can't wedge) **without** the
/// user's edit being lost: it is retained here, surfaced via the needs-fix UI,
/// and cleared when a corrected re-save uploads (clear-on-success) or the user
/// dismisses it.
///
/// **Local-only** ([Table.localOnly]) on purpose: a rejected op (i) must never
/// sync up — it's a client-side needs-fix record, not domain data; (ii) must
/// survive an app restart (durability is the whole point); (iii) is org data
/// that must ride the §3.5 logout / membership-loss purge — and
/// `disconnectAndClear()` (via `LocalStoreEngine.clear()`) wipes local-only
/// rows too under its default `clearLocal: true`, so no extra teardown is
/// needed.
///
/// Keyed by **server identity**, not the local row id: [dedupKeyColumn] is the
/// apiary id for an `apiary` op and `"<apiary_id>:<counter_type>"` for an
/// `apiary_counter` op (a counter's local row id isn't stable across a
/// reject→fix cycle — `_upsertCounter` may re-INSERT after a down-sync). The
/// connector REPLACEs by that key (delete-then-insert; PowerSync's local schema
/// has no unique constraints, same as the counters table), so one live entry
/// per record. `fix_apiary_id` is the apiary the needs-fix "Fix" action
/// deep-links to (the apiary id for both op kinds).

/// implicit (client-generated UUID). `deleted_at` is NOT a local column:
/// the Sync Rules exclude tombstoned rows, so a server-side delete simply
/// leaves the client's result set and PowerSync removes the row locally.
///
/// `notes` (FR-AP-8, #196) is optional free-text, nullable like the server
/// column it mirrors.
///
/// `location_lon`/`location_lat` (FR-AP-2/FR-AP-3/FR-AP-5, #33/#34/#37) are
/// plain nullable REAL columns — the Sync Rules bucket for
/// `apiaries.apiaries` projects the server's PostGIS
/// `geography(Point,4326)` column to these via `ST_X`/`ST_Y(location)`
/// (infra/helm/beekeepingit/charts/powersync/values.yaml — no `::geometry`
/// cast: PowerSync's sync-rules SQL parser doesn't support casting to
/// PostGIS types, and ST_X/ST_Y accept `geography` directly) rather than
/// streaming the raw geography column, which arrives in a wire form (EWKB)
/// this client has no parser for. Both null together when the apiary has no
/// stored location (nullable, matching the DB column's own optionality).
/// Used by #33's offline proximity ordering and #34/#37's map + offline
/// distance measurement alike. #252 wires these into the create/edit WRITE
/// path too (apiaries_repository.dart) — previously only ever read, never
/// written locally, so an in-app-created apiary had no coordinates even
/// though this column pair already existed.
///
/// `place_label` (#252) is an optional free-text place name (e.g.
/// "Montargil"), independent of `location`'s coordinates and of the
/// apiary's own `name` — nullable like `notes`, same plain-text column
/// shape (no projection needed, unlike location).
///
/// `hive_count` is NOT a column on [apiariesTable] anymore (#256): it was
/// retired server-side (apiaries migration 00005) in favor of the
/// [apiaryCountersTable] 1-N child table below, and this local schema
/// mirrors that — the repository reads the hive count via a local LEFT JOIN
/// (0 when no row exists) and writes it as a counter row, never as an
/// apiaries column.
