# Data Codemap

Postgres (CloudNativePG) + PostGIS. Schema-per-service (no cross-schema FKs;
services own their data). Every owned row carries `organization_id` (tenancy).
Soft-delete via `deleted_at`. Append-only `audit_log` per schema (`FR-HIS`).
Migrations: goose, `services/<svc>/store/migrations/*.sql`, applied at boot.

## Schemas & tables

### `identity`

```text
users        (id PK, oidc_sub UNIQUE, name, email, locale, created_at, updated_at)
audit_log    (id PK, organization_id NULL, entity_type, entity_id, change_type,
              actor_user_id, occurred_at, recorded_at, changed_fields[], change JSONB)
```

`organization_id` is NULL here — users are global, not org-owned (history.md §9).

### `organizations`

```text
organizations (id PK, name, address, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
memberships   (id PK, organization_id FK→organizations, user_id, role[admin|user],
               status[active|invited|removed], UNIQUE(organization_id,user_id))
invitations   (id PK, organization_id FK→organizations, email, role,
               status[pending|accepted|expired|revoked], invited_by, timestamps)
audit_log     (… entity_type[organization|membership|invitation], change JSONB)
```

### `apiaries`

```text
apiaries          (id PK, organization_id, name, created_at, updated_at, recorded_at,
                   deleted_at, location geography(Point,4326) NULL, notes NULL≤10k,
                   place_label NULL≤200)          -- hive_count column RETIRED (#256)
apiary_counters   (id PK, organization_id, apiary_id FK→apiaries ON DELETE CASCADE,
                   counter_type, value≥0, UNIQUE(apiary_id,counter_type))   -- 1-N (#256)
sync_conflict_log (id PK, org_id, entity_type, entity_id, winning/losing_payload JSONB,
                   winner[server|client], actor_user_id, occurred_at, recorded_at)
audit_log         (… change_type[create|update|delete], changed_fields[], change JSONB)
```

`counter_type` validated in Go (`api/counters.go`), not a DB enum (extensible-enum convention).

### `activities`

```text
activities        (id PK, organization_id, apiary_id NULL-FK(soft), performed_by NULL-FK(soft),
                   journey_id NULL(soft, unused until M4), type, occurred_at DATE,
                   attributes JSONB, created_at, updated_at, recorded_at, deleted_at)
sync_conflict_log  (… same shape as apiaries.sync_conflict_log)
audit_log          (… same shape as apiaries.audit_log)
```

`type` + per-type `attributes` keys validated in Go (`api/types.go`'s type registry), not a
DB enum/CHECK (extensible-enum convention). #38 shipped the schema + validation only; #39
added create, #40/#41 added edit/delete (delete via `deleted_at` tombstone, same convention
as `apiaries.apiaries`) — both REST (`api/write.go`) and sync-apply (`api/sync.go`, LWW on
`updated_at`).

### `journeys`

```text
journeys           (id PK, organization_id, name, main_activity_type, status[open|closed],
                    created_at, updated_at, recorded_at, deleted_at)
journey_plan_items (id PK, organization_id, journey_id FK→journeys ON DELETE CASCADE,
                    apiary_id NULL-FK(soft), created_at, deleted_at,
                    UNIQUE(journey_id,apiary_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)
sync_conflict_log  (… same shape as apiaries.sync_conflict_log; `journey` entity only —
                    `journey_plan_item` ops are pure set-membership, nothing to LWW-compare)
audit_log          (… same shape as apiaries.audit_log; a plan add/remove is folded into a
                    `journey`-entity "update" row, changed_fields=["apiary_ids"])
```

`main_activity_type` + `status` validated in Go (`api/types.go`), not a DB enum/CHECK —
`main_activity_type`'s known set is a HAND-KEPT MIRROR of `activities/api/types.go`'s own
registry (no cross-module import — services depend on each other's data by ID, never code).
#45 shipped the full CRUD surface (create/edit/close/delete) in one story. Journey↔activity
attribution is `activities.journey_id` (D-21), NOT a table in this schema.

### `todos`

```text
todos             (id PK, organization_id, title, description NULL, due_date DATE NULL,
                   priority[low|medium|high], status[open|done] DEFAULT 'open',
                   completed_at NULL, assignee_id NULL-FK(soft, org member),
                   created_at, updated_at, recorded_at, deleted_at)
sync_conflict_log  (… same shape as apiaries.sync_conflict_log)
audit_log          (… same shape as apiaries.audit_log)
```

`priority`/`status` validated in Go (`api/types.go`, D-20), not a DB enum/CHECK
(extensible-enum convention). No JSONB attributes bag — every FR-TD-1 field is a plain typed
column, unlike `activities.activities`. `assignee_id` (D-23, optional) is a cross-service soft
reference verified against `organizations.memberships` via `api/members_client.go` (an HTTP
call — todos has no DB access to the organizations schema). #50 shipped the full model +
lifecycle in one story: create/edit (REST full resubmit) + complete/reopen (narrow
status/completed_at update) + delete (`deleted_at` tombstone) — both REST (`api/write.go`)
and sync-apply (`api/sync.go`, LWW on `updated_at`; complete/reopen apply as an ordinary
patch, no bespoke wire op). Apiary association (#51) and list/filter (#53) are out of scope —
no `apiary_id` column yet.

## Relationships

```text
identity.users ──(oidc_sub ← JWT sub; user_id ref, no FK)──► organizations.memberships
organizations.organizations ─1─N─► memberships, invitations
apiaries.apiaries ─1─N─► apiary_counters (hive count lives here, not on apiaries)
apiaries.apiaries ─1─N─► audit_log / sync_conflict_log  (by entity_id, same schema)
```

Cross-service links are by id only (id resolved via internal APIs, e.g. org-resolver),
never SQL FKs — each schema is independently owned.

## Client-side (on-device SQLite, PowerSync — powersync_schema.dart)

```text
apiaries          (id, organization_id, name, notes, place_label,
                   location_lon REAL, location_lat REAL, created_at, updated_at)
apiary_counters   (id, organization_id, apiary_id, counter_type, value, timestamps)
sync_rejected_ops (LOCAL-ONLY dead-letter: dedup_key, fix_apiary_id, op, payload,
                   error_code, error_detail, rejected_at)               -- D-12
activities        (id, organization_id, apiary_id, performed_by, journey_id, type,
                   occurred_at, attributes TEXT(JSON-encoded), created_at, updated_at)
journeys          (id, organization_id, name, main_activity_type, status, created_at,
                   updated_at)
journey_plan_items(id, organization_id, journey_id, apiary_id, created_at)
                   -- #45: two local tables, two sync entity types (`journey`/
                   -- `journey_plan_item`), mirroring apiaries/apiary_counters' own split
todos             (id, organization_id, title, description, due_date, priority, status,
                   completed_at, assignee_id, created_at, updated_at)
                   -- #50: plain typed columns, no JSON-encoded attributes column needed
```

Projection: server `location geography` → client `location_lon/lat` via `ST_X`/`ST_Y`
in PowerSync Sync Rules (`infra/helm/.../powersync/values.yaml`). Tombstones excluded
down-sync (no local `deleted_at`).

## Conventions

- **sqlc**: `store/sqlc/queries/*.sql` → `store/sqlc/gen/*.sql.go`; `schema.sql` is a
  codegen-only virtual mirror of the cumulative migrations (kept in sync by hand).
- **History**: writes append an `audit_log` row (delta via `shared/history`); immutability
  enforced by a DB job (`infra/helm/.../postgres/templates/audit-immutability-job.yaml`).

See [backend.md](backend.md) for the query layer, [architecture.md](architecture.md) for sync.
